L Train Monday
We got onto the crowded L on Monday 1/21 around noon. You didn't notice me until you looked up from your phone and I hadn't noticed how handsome you are. You have blue eyes, long dirty blonde hair. 
We caught a couple of glances going into the city. I got off on 3rd Ave and wished I'd looked back. I have dark hair and a gold septum ring.    
Alitalia
We were on the same flight going from Rome to New York. I saw you the second you got on the flight and I couldn't take my eyes off you. It was like one of those cliche movie scenes with A George Michael song playing in the background. You sat down right next to me with an empty seat between us. You said hello to me with your piercing beautiful eyes and I was so lost for words. Throughout the 9 hour 10 minute on the flight, I kept stealing glances at you. You had half of your face covered with your black hoodie and I thought you were sleeping. I wanted to kiss your lips and cuddle up next to you. I was completely shocked when you turned your head to face me. You know I am into you and was staring at you the entire time. I was clueless. I finally had the courage to write a note down along with my number, but I didn't know how to slip it to you! I held it until the very last minute and still couldn't do it. And the worst thing was, when we landed and we were about to leave, I saw you looking everywhere for something. If I could go back in time in that moment, I would muster all my courage and just talk to you, I would slip you my number. And if you weren't interested, I could at least say I gave it my all. Now, I would never know! This might be a long shot, but if you're reading this out there, please get in touch with me! I would love to go out for coffee and more! Haha.

Halloween 2009, The Dark Room, Guy Dressed as one of The Three Amigos
There's a .001 in a million chance you'll ever see this. I feel crazy for even writing this post. 
It was Halloween 2009. We met at The Dark Room on the lower east side. You were dressed as one of the three amigos. I was Alice from Alice In Wonderland. I bet you money you'd never guess my name. 
We danced and you tried to kiss me. I told you I had a boyfriend and that things were rocky, but that I couldn't cheat. You gave me your number and said "If it doesn't work out with your boyfriend, give me a call."
I spent two more years in that relationship, which I came to eventually realize was an abusive one. 
Memories of you, of that night, have stayed with me all these years. What if you were the out I never took? What if you were my chance to escape, and I chose not to?
I get that a lot of people will say- "hey everything happens for a reason." Maybe we weren't met to meet again. Maybe you would have been a fling or another shitty guy who broke my heart. Maybe in the light of day, without costumes and liquor, we would have had a "what the hell was I thinking moment." 
But what if you were the choice I was supposed to make, and I made the wrong one? 
I guess I just need to know. I met tons of guys in NYC around this time, you're the only one who stayed in my mind. Maybe it has nothing to do with you, but with my own regrets. The romantic in me wants the cheesy rom-com ending though.

Hunts Point Train Station. Wish I didn't get off so soon at Longwood
Damn. I really wish I didn't have to take the 6 train back only one stop to Longwood Avenue. I was going to drop you my number but some old dude indirectly cock blocked you. LOL.
You were Hispanic, rose tattoo on neck (fn sexy) and another I couldn't quite make out... small black gauges in your ears, turquoise blue shoes and black pants and shirt. Longish hair
I hope you see this or we run into each other again. That was no consequence!  You had me smiling the whole walk home.

The beautiful dark haired girl on the F train
Hey, you sat across from me going towards Manhattan. All though I noticed you, you didn't notice me. You have beautiful dark hair, fair/pale complexion, maybe in your 30's or late 20's. I'm guessing you're a creative or poetic person. It would be nice to connect with you.    
I thought you were smiling at my dog
Me- tall, female, gray hat walking down 39th- You- male, tall, dark jacket, black hat, dark hair with a very nice smile which I thought was directed at my dog (he is a cute dog). 20 min later, I saw you again on 39th just before 9th avenue- you were on your phone and smiled again. You kept turning around after you walked by while my dog lollygagged...forgive me, I'm slow on the pick up. When I turned around to find you, you were gone. Both of us were sad to have missed you. Wanna go for a walk?

You're not disgusting. You're beautiful. I'm sorry that other dude freaked out at you. What a bummer! He obviously has his own internalized thoughts and beliefs about male sexuality. 
I hope you were able to leave without being harassed. I tried to talk to him to calm him down. Sending you a supportive brotherly nuzzle and hug.

Indian woman at The Bean w/Snow White sticker on her MacBook/Oct

Master here trying to reconnect with my sub
I am trying to reconnect with a white sub I met here a couple of years ago. I knew you by a couple of names. One starting with the letter A and the other S. You used to eat my ass, give me head and on occasion I would fuck you. We used to have food and drinks at your place. You would offer to do some chores for me or run errands. You lived in a building with a door man. I believe the 13th or 16th floor. My guess is by now you are in your late 30s. You were healthy, lived comfortably. This is a long shot but I would like to get in contact with you again. If you see this send me a reply.

Guy on F TRAIN
You hopped on 34th St. I was sitting directly across from you. Your are a handsome older man mostly black hair  your eyes are brown and THICK. you always wear dark colored work cargo pants possibly green, Black air max sneakers,black shoulder bag and black jacket on your Lapel you have a pin of a blue rifle and on the right side A black pin of the holy cross and your always listening to music with your BOSE ear buds. I have seen you a few times on the F TRAIN, some times you get off on DITMAS ave with different very pretty women, as a matter of fact I've seen you with quite a few women. one time I was stuck in traffic and I happen to look over and you were sitting on your stairs talking too a tall women. now I always pass by you home and sometimes I see you in your driveway playing with a cat, very cute.   WOW your HOT and no wedding ring that's a plus. I know one thing for sure no women could ever tie you down. lets have a drink or something. If this is you tell me what street you live on.    
.... aka Lily
The look of you dancing on the sand under my window in the early morning chill is how I found you. Beautiful in your carefree, embarrassed to find an audience. Your laugh, your smile, your humor, all woman and so damn smart. I miss you.
When last I saw you you were so sad. We danced a quiet dance with the stars and your tears. The closest we've ever been. Timing. Didn't imagine I wouldn't see you again. We are new friends but friends nonetheless I think. I would like to know you more. If you'll let me help you see your way out of silence, I've got some champagne. We can toast the heavens and dance again.

Gersi Restaurant
You were with a friend. I was with my dad. Let's get a drink?

Q Train, Whistling Jazz Near 7 PM Saturday Night (1/19)
We briefly met eyes several times on the northbound Q Train - you a petite female with glasses, looking through and annotating  a book of musical scores (I think) - me a "young" male in my early 60's with salt and pepper hair and a mustache (I'm bad at guessing ages but you are considerably younger); I was wearing a parka and whistling jazz. Out of politeness I was conscious of not making my interest seem intrusive to you during the ride (I'm not certain what stop you got on at) but I'm kicking myself because as you got ready to leave between the 7th Avenue and Atlantic Avenue/Metrotech Center stations in Brooklyn, where you got off, you started  to whistle along with me and seemed to be looking at me through the corner of your eye. I watched you exit the train still whistling and was in a quandary as to whether I should be risque and just run off the train and invite you for coffee, but the doors closed too fast and the train continued on its way. If you still believe in magic and read this and would like to have that coffee with me and be friends please respond to this post as soon as possible and I will joyfully do the same to yours!! :-) :-) :-)  
To "Lemon Water": Thank you for your long message. I'm very sorry for your pain but have no idea who you are nor do I understand your referrences, or what anything has to do with my post. Blessings.

From the looks of it... youre unmarried and in your late 30s. I'm in my early 20s.. maybe you havent approached me because i look much younger. At my desk, I imagine all sorts of crazy things like you having my future kids. so cheesy but i cant stop thinking about you.

Javier    
I thought you were staring at me...were you?
You were with 2 girls and a guy at The Big Whisky to watch the football game sitting all the way in the back. When my family and I entered and stood behind your group, you commented on how big a pile our coats made. I felt you staring at me the rest of the night but you never said anything. Were you or was I dreaming?    
As the Guggenheim was closing on Monday..
We were both viewing the work of Hilma af Klint, making our way up the spiral of her life's final work. I rushed back down to get a catalog before the shop closed. I noticed you once more on my way out, standing by the exit. I should have just asked - what did you think of the exhibition and particularly the "Alterpieces"?    
Dani, bacon carcinogen
You were in front of me in line, I dissuaded you from getting bacon accidentally, your card declined so you were on the phone when I left. You seem cool and I forgot how impossible it is to run into someone accidentally in nyc.

M4W Friends amigos con derechos
Looking to make a friends I'm male Spanish  piel canela quiero conocer  amigas coquetonas y juguetonas atrevidas extrovertidas locas to have fun 

Who you are not:  EZ  =  Who this is from:  PMJ
With the cold that swept in I bundled up and braved the elements as the Sun shone brightly today and in winters like these the Rays mean life no matter such bitingly clear air and slickened roads and as I saw her resting on the couch just now with lavendar and white embroidered blanket upon 15-year old dirty suede another frayed blanket of sea horses shells waves crabs and lighthouses I knew Rasa doesn't have many years left after todays walk, if years are left at all and that made me think back to Madison and how the ole blubber butt Miss Chubbers, my Maddy might outlive her sis, 13-years to 12, though ti was August '15 when Madisonia Harmonia crossed over and thinking how Rasa limps on the hind quarter now and her front shoulder is swollen and the difficulty she has moving as she once did, frolickin free and scimper scamperin away faster than any around could catch her and now old age has set in though she still smiles and grins and there isnt any way I could take that away but it is not mine to take though it is going slowly yet painfully obviously day by day and it has me thinking how i would say to you to please take care and be sure your footing is sure and your warmth secure, wear layers, bundle up, brave the cold but be sure you fight off the old.   
youtu.be/m3lF2qEA2cw
all that is truly loved is never truly lost, tears though there be, which got me remembering how casually discardant the tonal of this day is, how easy to easily it is to obliterate another, flick, with the flip of a switch, a change of the channel, another reality appears as if on speed dial, magic in the modern era.
that casual obliteration our species discards in today buries more than any dirge could do true justice.

re If you only knew sir
Not worth biting the bullet huh?!    
M for F / L train to A train connection in the cold
I almost asked whether I knew you, because you looked at me as though that might be true. You: strawberry blonde, ski hat, clear frames, petite, look like a normal person. Me: white guy, 40's, furry Eastern European hat, black coat, medium height, dark mustache, white beard. I got out at 34th st, you stayed on. Seemed like there was a connection of some kind, not sure what. Wanna have a coffee and find out?    
Gorgeous guy on C train
You had on blue jeans with jean patches on the knee. Winter hat. Brown boots. I had a fur trimmed hat on. We smiled at each other right before I got off at 23 Street. Wish we had talked.

Saw you on downtown F train around 23rd St. (Jan. 21)
I've never done this before but figured I would give it a shot- I saw you today on the F train around 2:00 at 23rd St. When I got on, there was a woman screaming which is when we first kind of noticed each other. My friend and I ended up switching cars and a few minutes later you switched into the same car. The minute you did, another homeless man walked on. I think you got off at Broadway Lafayette and for a split second considered running out to give you my number haha but obviously didn't. So just thought I would try this out in the off chance you see this and reply!    
Saw you on the N train at night m4m
Saw you on the N train heading to Astoria at night, you look like you were going home after work. We looked at each other for a while but my station came too soon to talk. Would like to connect somehow.

held the door at 59th on the A at around 5:30, you got off at 168th
I was a little scruffy,  long black coat, cashmere sweater and oxfords. I've never done this before, but you seemed nice. If you want to get in touch, describe yourself.

LGA
We locked eyes in the men's restroom near baggage claim at LGA... You seemed interested... You left before me, but we kept cruising each other and staring while waiting on our Ubers. 
I would love to meet up one day... Let me know what terminal and airline we were at so I know it's really you... I know this is a long shot, but I'll stay optimistic!
You were maybe Latino male, masculine, with a hoodie, sweats and hat on... Me, black male with dreadlocks...

F4M Long shot at you seeing this

Mr. Felton
Attention, Mr. Felton (J. Felton or Y. Felton, whichever you are using now):
STOP giving your old number out. I have had this number for TEN YEARS and I still get calls for you. I will start hurting your reputation if I do not see a change in the frequency with which your name is presented on the phone. I know you are still putting this number down as your own when you sign up for things. STOP IMMEDIATELY.

Washington Sq. Park Circa '85 -'88
Looking to start a community Forum with all the young kids that used to hang out in the park back in 1985 through the early 90s. That was a Golden Era of the '80s for us. I was there...with all the graff artists all the downtown kids, the Brooklyn kids & the uptown Manhattan/Bronx kids... we all converged on Washington Square Park. I've been reminiscing lately...I know we're all probably in our 40s early 50s...but there's a lot of memories & stories to share. Give me shout...I can recall most of the crowd...remember the original Tunnel with the rail tracks was the spot. Save the robots, The World, Sticky Mike's. Frankie Soul Food etc... If anyone knows of a group forum/chat that already exist, let me know...Thanks!

we traded dollar bills in the laundromat (f4m)
I was fighting with the coin machine in the laundromat when you offered to switch bills with me. Thanks again, the coin gods seemed much more pleased with your offering than mine. You took me by surprise because I wasn't exactly dressed or made up for the occasion or expecting to bump heads with someone so good-looking while doing my Sunday laundry. Whoops.
I wanted to speak to you but after some moments I looked up from the book I was engrossed in and realized you'd left- too bad!
I'm sure this is a long-shot but if it's indeed you and you'd like to grab coffee or shoot the shit sometime, tell me what I looked like or what street the laundromat was located off of?

Bar near washington square park
We met at bar near Washington square park, and went home together. Next day I found out you were seeing someone and didn't want any drama so I didn't answer when you called. Thinking maybe I should have answered. You're a white female im guessing late 20's to mid thirties, I was the buff guy you kept tellingme how you love my hair. If this rings a bell message me would love to give it another go.    
You were at the bar with me.
I have a huge crush on you. I cant take it. I know you complimented me last night. I feel like in the back of your mind, you think you should be careful, while like me, you enjoy a little danger.  Im a little afraid myself of trying something with you, anything scares me but I want it. I cant help it. You were so sweet and classy that you have made yourself irresistible. I told you you can text anytime. I will never have the nerve to tell you what i think, and what i daydream. it was nice how you left me, but youre too sweet.  Hope we wont be a missed connection.  I dont want to lose you. I also want you, just for a moment in time. I long to be alone with you for just a while. I promise you wouldnt forget me.

Where are you Ann?    
At the Funeral Today...
...I sat across from you. 
I tried not to look at you. I tried, oh so hard, to keep my eyes off of you. I thought if I looked at you something would jump from you to me and I would be lost. 
Of course, it was futile. I knew I couldn't, that I wouldn't, be strong enough not to eventually let my eyes fall upon you. I knew, know, that I am weak. At least where you are concerned. 
So, I let my gaze move to you. You are so beautiful. I have always thought so. I have always adored you. Have always been your fool. 
Looking at you, I remembered the first time I saw you. All those years ago. I remembered every time we were together. Every time you trembled. You screamed. Every tiny rive of blood that came from our skin. 
I let my eyes study your face and reflect those past days and nights. I stared at your face until I finally found the courage and strength to force them from it. I willed them away. They moved down to your neck. 
At that moment I realized, hypnotized by the beautiful skin on your neck, that I wanted to plunge my teeth into it. That I wanted to penetrate you and suck your fluids from your body. 
I blinked, and it hit me, that was exactly what you had done to me. Sucked the life out of me and my soul. That there was nothing good left. Only something dried, crusted, and dead remained. 
You took a breath and your chest moved. The movement broke the trance. It wasn't really the movement but the realization that something wasn't moving below. 
It was the still body lying between us. Your chest was moving and the body, flat on it's back, was not. It wasn't moving at all. It was cold. 
Thinking of the body, and then again of all those times with you, I felt sick. I wanted to throw up. Part of me even wanted to throw up on you. I have spilled just about every other fluid on you, why not that?
Dead now, somebody who used to be my friend. You two were supposed to be together, always, and forever. But you came between us litereally. You put yourself between us. Your body between ours. 
The movement of your next breath, and the stillness of that body. It flashed through my mind that you two should always be together. It flashed into me, that I wanted to jump up, grab you by force, once again rip off your clothes, and then throw you on top of the body of my old friend. 
Then, with you on the body, fuck you until you two were together again. Together forever. Fuck you dead. 
At the funeral today, I saw you. Thought of us. Thought of you. Thought of the two of you. 
I got up, eveybody fixed their eyes on me. The man stopped speaking. I looked at none of them. I didn't look at you. I dare not try. With a hundred eyes on me, I only looked at the body one more time. 
One last glance, then out I went. Out to a chorus of gasps. The sickening whispers. The weight of what we had done, and all those nauseating eyes on me. As I put my hand on the wood of the door, I almost turned back. But steeled myself and went out. 
At the funeral today, just outside the door, with the thought of you knifing my brain, I threw up in the archway. The last emotion you will ever wrench out of me. 
At the funeral today, I sat across from you for the last time. Rest in peace.

You Heard Me Fart...
Yesterday was the most embarrassing day of my life..
I'm still so ashamed..
I had no idea that you were at your desk when I unleashed a nastyTaco Bell fart that I was fighting back all morning.
I just couldn't keep that dirty old man in my stomach any longer.
And to make matters worse, I yelled out " Yea Baby! "
When I passed your cubicle and saw you sitting there, I died a thousand deaths.
But you just kept reading...
How considerate...
I always thought that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen. And I often think about asking you out for dinner and holding your hand.
But that will never happen now.
Why would you go out with a Frankenstein like me??
A laughing creature who thinks that everything is a joke.
I went to see you yesterday but they said that you called out.
I hope you are well.

Killarney Rose on Friday Night
You are the incredibly beautiful and sexy woman who was at the bar just before closing. You were wearing a black Islanders sweatshirt and multicolored tights. You had dark brown hair, a cute smile, and looked like you would be really fun to talk to. You looked fantastic! I would have bought you a drink but you were buying drinks and counseling another guy about marriage and I didn't want to interrupt. If you see this now (by any chance) I'd love to take you for a drink and flirting right now and let's see what happens. But if not now, let's meet up soon.

I got on the L train at 14th and 1st Avenue and got off at the next stop, Bedford Ave/North 7th Street, but you stayed on. We made eye contact a few times and then you closed your eyes as if to shut out the commotion around you. You were wearing high-top white converse and had a camera around your neck. You're eyes had a kindness to them that I can't stop thinking about.    
You were the cute guy at Barnes & Noble
NOTE: I am a CD.
The other night I was at Barnes & Noble wearing my red dress, I was reading, working, etc..
You were the nerdy guy there, reading and working too. Maybe studying.

I am going to go there now and I will be there for a couple of hours.  
Meet you there? Come and talk to me this time.    
D/B Train Eye Flirting on Friday Jan 18th
I'm looking for the gorgeous blonde lady that had her hair in a pigtail braid on the D/B train at ~8:15am on Friday, January 18th. I got on at W 4th St, walked towards you at the Bryant Park stop where our eyes locked for a fleeting moment. We both exited the train at Rockefeller Center and our eyes met again atop the stairs. I was still thinking of what to say to you when you jogged up at stairs and swiped into the elevator bank at 1270 Avenue of the Americas. My morning was crushed. I'm the guy that was in a suit and rain jacket, and really hope you find this...    
I am so sorry...
Please know that it is from my heart that I love you and adore you.
I'm forever in love with you.  It was never a game.  
But without words, how can one let the other know how much one needs the other in one's life?
Blue light by the shore...I will always remember you.

Delta Pilot at JFK T4
I've seen you before.  You must fly out of JFK often.  We have made eye contact a few times.  You always smile.  Today I saw you in the restroom. I stood next to you at the urinal.  We spent longer than usual standing there.  Your arm movement indicated you were doing more than peeing.  We zipped up together and you made sure that I noticed your semi aroused cock.  Again you smiled and this time a wink.

Missed connection? Uhhhhm...
Where are you?? I'm so profoundly depressed, almost debilitatingly so, but it helps with my creativity and I've ironically been writing the best music of my life because of it. But when was I not so sad? Is that a time that ever existed? Or some kind of phantom memory that I think happened, just can't recall? Will I get a chance at love? Will I ever find you? I'm terrified by the thought of me passing you on the streets every day of our lives in this city of 9 million people, not even knowing that we're meant to be together. Talk about a fucking missed connection. Why am I writing on Craigslist I don't do shit like this. I'll try to be introspective. I guess it's because I want some girl to message me so I have someone to talk to. I haven't been in NYC long, and I don't have any friends. It hurts to be lonely. My 27th birthday was recent and some good friends back from my hometown in Savannah acknowledged me on Facebook and said they loved and missed me but that was the climax of my birthday. I just want to be with you though. Whoever you are. Just want to talk to you. Get to know everything I can about you. Love you and be loved. The world is truly unforgivable, because I don't even know you. Maybe you don't even exist and I'll spend my entire life looking for you and you're not real. I picture you smart and witty, like me. Fast and articulate, we can talk forever but when we don't, it's the exact opposite of awkward silence filling in the blanks. I need you. I picture you with black hair for some reason. Like mine. I see your vague image in my mind as pale and beautiful. And you listen to me play my music sometimes and you want me to write about you and of course I do too but it's so hard to put something so intense into words isn't it? Even for us, and we're rarely at a lack of words. I picture us cuddling and us watching Wes Anderson movies or Charlie Kaufman or Paul Thomas Anderson, and us talking about all of their almost painfully perfect and brilliant way of expressing his art form of cinematography. I imagine teaching you about all the underground indie folk-punk bands with the lyrics so deep and real it's almost as if it's the only real music in the world. But it's not. I like your music too, of course because you like them, and who knows maybe you already loved all the bands I thought I was introducing you to. We laugh a lot and we have so many inside jokes and other couples envy us because what we have is more real than life itself. Please find me and save me. I need love and I need you to know what a beautiful creature you are and I want to spend the rest of my life exploring every part of your body and it could be you that I'm looking for. You, reading this right now. But how the fuck would I know? How the fuck would you know though for that matter? Message me please, don't be shy. I've flayed and gutted myself on Craigslist for everyone to gain entertainment. But it doesn't matter, I don't care about everyone. Because this was for you. If you're an intellectual and funny and lonely girl in nyc, message me and let's see if I can at least make my first friend here, or maybe more.

Slim Male for any lucky ladies
I'm new to the area. Single. 
No drama. No kids. No chance of pet allergens. Totally not on drugs. Definitely not a criminal. I'm not asking for money.  This is not a scam. I don't need anything more than just your name. I have to know who i'm talking to, duh, lol. 
Also, I like cuddling. Hugging. Massages (giving and recieving). Hot showers. Comedy. Randomness. Holding hands. Getting kissed anywhere. Video games. Anime. Drumming. Sleeping naked under certain warm circumstances. (I HATE extreme weather temperatures). Water is my main drink. I'm not a health psycho, but I do enjoy healthy foods. 
Not into religion. 
Not into politics. 
Not into rap music. 
My intelligence quota may exceed median comprehension. But i'm not douche about it. 
Just don't stalk me because of my sex skills. A simple text to come to my place or to invite me to your place is sufficient. Thanks. 
If you try too hard to steal my attention, you're probably going to push me away. Just be yourself. Honestly tell me what you want and don't like. Don't spam messages just cause i'm not responding instantly. I could be working, sleeping, showering, shitting, gaming, watching a quick anime or charging my phone. I'll always tell you if you ask. 
I've got nothing to lose. But please honestly tell me if you have a boyfriend or husband. 
A little heads up would be appreciated in case some angry guy tracks your phone location to my house. 
I don't need a surprise fight.    
Uptown 5 - Cool Laptop
You: Moon and ocean skin on laptop with a pair of big headphones with a red wire running through them, dressed in a suit? Black or deep, deep blue/gray. 
Dark charcoal grey boots, ashy in color
Black and white scarf but looks gray, maybe a mixed knit 
Striped tie, dark in color with white stripes 
Either about 5'10 or 5'9 or taller on an uptown 5 around 12pm this afternoon, I got on at Borough Hall/Brooklyn Bridge and couldn't take my eyes off you while you typed. 
You had the most beautiful curly hair and deep brown skin, on the off chance you ever see this I would love to take you out.
P.S. I'm a woman who sat opposite you today    
Ticket to Yams Day 2019 Today
Hello. My date cancelled out on me and I have an extra ticket I don't want to go to waste. If you want it you can have it. You'll have to meet me at the Barclays center as I'm new to New York. It's free.    
Sexy Tall Woman, CVS
I just wanted you to know that I didn't chicken out because of you. You reminded me of Uma Thurman, in Kill Bill. You are beyond hot in so many ways.
No, I chickened out because of me. Because I have nothing to offer you. I am starting over again, from zero this time. Check that - Less than zero. Just at the beginning, too. 
But I wanted you to know that just by you smiling at me, and then looking over at me a few times in the parking lot, you gave me a bit of hope for whats to come for me in the future.
I have a feeling I'll be ok. Thanks for that.
